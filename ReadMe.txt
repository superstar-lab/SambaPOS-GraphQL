You select the table it would bring the bill and there would be a button to press for Pay Now.
when you click payNow it would perform the transaction.
You have to install SambaPOS.

I wanna make the script like this.
1. The script is suppose to grab 1) Active tables (empty, printed bills and, seated) Total Value for Selected Table
2. Close table script once payment is made.
